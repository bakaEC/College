I've never read Harry Potter before,but I have watched movies about it.
In my poor memory,the story is about after being raised in the miserably unfair home of his Uncle,
Harry started a new life when he discovers that he is a wizard and is invited to attend Hogwarts. 
Among Harry’s first-year adventures are making new friends (Hagrid, Ron and Hermione), 
standing up to the torments of school bully, and becoming the star player on his Quidditch team.
Harry’s life as a Hogwarts is more interesting than that of most attendees, because he is already famous for surviving the attack of the evil Lord Voldemort,
who tried to kill him since he was born. 
Everyone in the wizard world knows more about Harry’s family and his story than he does, so the story is mainly about the journey of Harry Potter to find his identity and defeat the evils.
